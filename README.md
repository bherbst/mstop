# M-Stop
I was at an [FRC Team 2052 (KnightKrawler)](https://www.team2052.com/) while some programming students were iterating on the team's autonomous code, and I was thinking about the extra brake pedal for driving instructors in cars designed for driver's education. Wouldn't it be cool if we had an extra brake pedal (e-stop button) for FRC mentors?

Now we do!
